There are two versions of the list available, which can be accessed from the releases tab. If you intend to utilize the UDB version, please visit [Universal-Android-Debloater](https://github.com/0x192/universal-android-debloater/releases) // Alternatively, if you prefer to use the script version, you will need to obtain adb tools for your OS and place them in the same folder as the script.
Please report your issues to the issues section I'll check the issues tab every once in a while.
Also here's a link that has a list of foss applications for [Android-FOSS](https://github.com/offa/android-foss).
